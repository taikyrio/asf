// Main menu file - now simplified to import all menu modules
// This file serves as the entry point and ensures all menu functionality is loaded

// All menu functionality is now split across multiple files:
// - menuCore.js: Core menu object and itemListifier
// - menuProfile.js: Profile-related menu functions
// - menuRelationships.js: Relationships management
// - menuActivities.js: Activities and general actions
// - menuShopping.js: Shopping functionality
// - menuCareer.js: Career management
// - menuMusicCareer.js: Music career system
// - windowsSystem.js: Main windows object
// - windowsItems.js: Items-related windows

// The menu object is defined in menuCore.js and extended by other modules
// The windows object is defined in windowsSystem.js and extended by windowsItems.js

// No additional code needed here as all functionality is now modularized
